\chapter*{General Presentation of Problematic} 
Recently, with the rapid development of  sensors that can take measures in various different fields,From healthcare, Logistic, Traffic Data, Smart Buildings and Industries, Meanwhile, it generates a lot of problems to be solved, and one crucial problem is missing values\cite{dempetrubin}. Most systems can have enormous failure, or bad decision making based on missing data, Or even worst unreliable imputation methods that is biased.\\Missing Data produced by sensors is a very  critical problem to the majority of decision-making systems that impact human health, industrial output, and ecological risk or for any other field where making a decision based on data. Data sets that are corrupted with inaccurate results or missing data can significantly influence summary statistics and their interpretations. Continuous time series data is collected by different stations and systems, the missing data can be produced due to the transfer problems or natural disaster that can damage devices (sensors), or any external factor, furthermore this leads us to the question “ How can we impute data that does not exist ? ”, An important question will raise between statisticians and Data scientists, is when do we have right to impute, in other way what are the cases we have for missing data. Rubin (1976) \cite{rubin} classified missing data problems into three categories. In his theory every data point has some likelihood of being missing. There is a process governing it all usually called Data Mechanism or Response Mechanism.little \& Rubin divided the types of missing data according to the assumptions based on the reasons for the missing data \cite{}.
Estimation stage, the maximum likelihood estimates are determined for each model parameter. Finally in the diagnostics stage, the residuals are analysed and model comparisons are done. If the model fits well then the standardised residuals behave as an i.i.d. with mean zero and variance one.
In the next chapter we will go through Some of the famous approaches in  literature about Imputation approaches.
